# uPyExplorer 
## Explorer for Micropython for ESP32 , ESP8266 and ...
I actually wanted to program my ESP32. I installed all tools and environments and looked for modern tools to set up my ESP32. The found tools put me in the 80s of the last century. So my project is now the uPyExplorer.

Tests with esp32 and esp8266 on Ubuntu and Windows Python 3.X
